                                                   SugarRushAnalysis - Python

This project involves the analysis of a dataset named "SugarRush.csv," which contains information about various mobile apps. The dataset is explored using Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

The data comprises seven columns: "Month," "App," "Downloads," "Uninstalls," "5-star ratings," "1-star ratings," and "Total ratings." Initial exploratory data analysis involves checking the data types, information, and statistics of the dataset.

The project includes data cleaning steps, such as handling missing values in the "Total ratings" column by filling them with the mean. Further, insights are gained by querying the dataset to find apps with specific rating criteria and exploring summary statistics for each app.

Visualizations, including line graphs, histograms, bar charts, pie charts, count plots, box plots, scatter plots, and correlation heatmaps, provide a comprehensive understanding of the data. Additionally, statistical measures like mean, minimum, and maximum total ratings for each app are calculated.

The correlation matrix and scatterplots help in exploring relationships between variables like downloads, uninstalls, 5-star ratings, and total ratings. The project concludes with a comprehensive analysis of the dataset, providing valuable insights into app performance, user ratings, and relationships between different variables.
